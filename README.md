UFO-level-1 
Automatic Table and Date Search

Created a basic HTML web page (index.html file) to display a dynamically created table with functionality that allows users to filter the table data for specific values.
- With the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects (data.js), I wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. Also, using a date form in the index.html file, I wrote JavaScript code that includes event listeners and searches through the date/time column to find rows that match user input (app.py).

UFO-level-2 (Bonus)
Multiple Search Categories 

--- IN PROGRESS --- 
(to be completed asap)

Will use multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns to write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
   - date/time
   - city
   - state
   - country
   - shape
